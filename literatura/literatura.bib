abstract = {A contact function for two arbitrary ellipsoids is derived. The numerical value of the contact function is less than 1 if they overlap, and greater than 1 if they do not. This extends previous work by Vieillard-Baron, who derived an overlap criterion for spheroids without use of a contact function. The equivalence of the two criteria has been checked by extensive numerical test with spheroids. It is shown that the use of the contact function greatly facilitates the calculation of the pressure in Monte Carlo simulations.}

abstract = {Ray tracing is nearly synonymous with noise. Importance sampling and low-discrepancy sequences can help reduce noise by converging more quickly, and denoisers can remove noise after the fact, but sometimes we still cannot afford the number of rays needed to get the results we want. If using more rays is not an option, the next best thing is to make the noise harder to see and easier to remove. This chapter talks about using blue noise toward those goals in the context of ray traced soft shadows, but the concepts presented translate to nearly all ray tracing techniques.},
